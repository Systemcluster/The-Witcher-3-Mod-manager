## Usage

Download and unpack the latest release from Nexus Mods or from the GitHub releases. If you are upgrading from version 0.6 or later, directly overwrite the previous installation. Existing configuration files wll be searched in the same directory as the executable first, in `Documents\The Witcher 3 Mod Manager` second.

On the first run, if no configuration can be found, configuration files will be created under `Documents\The Witcher 3 Mod Manager`. They can be freely relocated between the two searched locations as preferred.

Download the source and install the requirements with `pipenv install --python 3`. Python 3.7+ and Pipenv have to be installed. Afterwards run with `pipenv run python main.py`.

On Linux, the configuration files will be created in `~/.config/TheWitcher3ModManager`, and `wine` has to be available to run Script Merger.

### Build Developed Versions (Windows)

Download the source and install the requirements with `pipenv install --python 3 --dev`. Python 3.7+ and Pipenv have to be installed. Afterwards run with `pipenv run python setup.py build_exe`.

The files will be created in `build/exe.[platform identifier].[python version]`.
